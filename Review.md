1. Advantages of project's design and organization:
- The project is simple, hence folder organization is quite clear and direct
- Scripts are divided into subfolders with clear purpose like Controller classes, UI classes, etc.
- Scripts are clean and easy to read

2. Disadvantages of project's design and organization
- Some parts of the game is loaded from Resources, which shouldn't since everything in Resources folder is packed into the final build, which increases the game build size. Game build size should be minimized to maximum due to App Store and Google Play Store policy, hence this is not good 
- Demigiant's DOTween can be moved into a new folder name Plugins and this Plugins folder should hold every plugins that would be added to project

3. My changes
- I've moved prefabs folder out of Resources folder and change the code to load data from scriptable objects instead of directly loading from Resources.
These changes are visible in scripts as well as scriptable object assets that end in DB suffix.
- I've detected that there is a FindObjectOfType call (in GameManager class), which shouldn't be used since it is not optimized. I've changed it so that it uses reference as a SerializedField
- For reskin parts, I'm currently adding Sprites as data in scriptable object asset and modify sprite field of SpriteRenderer component, but I suggest that it should use whole prefab instead of just SpritesList
- I've also added a base class for Singleton and convert GameManager class to a Singleton class accordingly for better and simpler access, considering it is a Manager class

4. Suggestions
- Spawning items should use object pooling, but I haven't been able to implement it due to time restriction
- Assets can be packed into Asset Bundles or Addressables for deployment purposes
- For the part of prioritizing items that have the least amount on board, my code there is not clean enough. It should have a separate class for handling this part but due to time restriction, I can only make a simple patch for the code
